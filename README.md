# BoredGames

## Introduction
Welcome to **BoredGames** a cross platform mobile application. The idea behind the application is a set of word games that can be played while out on walks or on long car journeys, you can play on your own or in a group. 
I mainly started this project purely to learn building a mobile app using [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin) from the ground up as a learning exercise.

`Please remember this is a work in progress and is being built in my spare time around work and an entire house renovation`
